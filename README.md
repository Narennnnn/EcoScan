# EcoScan - Clothing Carbon Footprint Scanner

## Overview
EcoScan is a mobile app designed to help users understand the environmental impact of their clothing. By uploading images of clothing items, users can see estimated carbon scores, earn eco-reward points, and redeem sustainability-focused offers. The app uses Azure Vision API to analyze clothing items and calculate their environmental impact.
