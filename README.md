# EcoScan - Clothing Carbon Footprint Scanner

## Overview
EcoScan is a mobile app designed to help users understand the environmental impact of their clothing. By uploading images of clothing items, users can see estimated carbon scores, earn eco-reward points, and redeem sustainability-focused offers. The app uses Azure Vision API to analyze clothing items and calculate their environmental impact.

##  Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repositories**  
   ```bash
   # Clone Frontend
   git clone https://github.com/Narennnnn/eco-scan-challenge.git
   cd eco-scan-challenge
   
   # Clone Backend
   git clone https://github.com/Narennnnn/eco-scan-challenge-backend.git
   cd eco-scan-challenge-backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd eco-scan-challenge
   npm install
   
   # Backend
   cd eco-scan-challenge-backend
   npm install
   ```
   
3. **Configure IP Address for Mobile Testing**
   ```bash
   # Find your PC's IP address
   # On Mac/Linux:
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   
   # On Windows:
   ipconfig
   ```

   Then update `services/scanService.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const getApiUrl = () => {
     if (Platform.OS === 'android' || Platform.OS === 'ios') {
       // Replace with your PC's IP address
       return 'http://YOUR_PC_IP:3000/api';  // Example: http://192.168.1.2:3000/api
     }
     return 'http://localhost:3000/api';
   };
   ```

   Important Notes:
   - Your PC and phone must be on the same WiFi network
   - Use your PC's actual IP address (not localhost) for testing on physical devices
   - localhost will work for iOS simulator as it runs on your Mac
   - For Android/ios devices, you must use your PC's IP address


4. **Run the Applications**
   - **Backend**: 
     ```bash
     npm start   # Runs on http://localhost:3000
     ```
   - **Frontend**: 
     ```bash
     npx expo start   # Launches Expo development server
     ```

4. **Development Builds**
   ```bash
   # iOS Simulator
   eas build --profile development --platform ios
   
   # Android Development
   eas build --profile development --platform android
   ```

---

##  Data Flow
1. User captures/selects image
2. Image sent to backend server
3. Azure Vision API analyzes image
4. Carbon score calculated
5. Results stored in Context API
6. Updates reflected across all screens
7. Data persisted locally using AsyncStorage

---

## Testing

- Run on iOS Simulator
- Test on Android devices
- Use Expo Go for quick testing
- Development builds for native testing
